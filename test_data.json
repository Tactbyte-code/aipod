  "details": "The reviews highlight recurring technical glitches in the app, such as data retrieval failures, compatibility issues, and frozen login screens, which hinder user experience. Customers express frustration with opaque billing systems, aggressive late fees, and an inability to cancel memberships without in-person visits. Privacy concerns arise from the app's data collection practices, while customer service is criticized for being unresponsive and unhelpful. These issues collectively paint a picture of a company prioritizing profit over user satisfaction, leading to a loss of trust and potential legal risks."
